                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Kiley, but I prefer to go by Kai. I am a current student, learning full stack web development. I hope by the end of this program I am able to become a web dev and to learn as much as I possibly can. I have been interested in code since Myspace, to date myself, and as much as it was unfortunate when this interest took a back-burner in my life, I am glad to be here now. I have added projects from both the beginning of my time in this program as well as current, in an effort to show both my knowledge and progress.</p>

                <p>I have been teaching children of all ages for the last four years of my life. I have worked from infants all the way to elementary schoolers. I have enjoyed my time teaching and as much as it is something I am still passionate about, I am ready for a change.</p>

                <p>I have been a student through the U of O bootcamp learning full stack web development. My interest seems to lie more with front-end development but I appreciate being able to learn both front and back end. I know the knowledge will help me one day down the road, and I find it all so fascinating regardless of where in the field I end up working.</p>

                <h6>Full Stack Web Development</h6>
                <p>As previously stated, I have a heavy interest in front-end development. I find the layout of web pages and apps extremely important, because what a user sees and how the app functions is what determines their use. But I have learned a new appreciation for back-end after needing to do it for multiple projects, and I think that the time and effort that goes into putting a coding puzzle together is incredible.</p>
